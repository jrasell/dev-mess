# Dev Mess
My little slice of development chaos including infrastructure tooling and
workstation configurations I use.

### Table of Contents

* [lab](./lab): Shared configuration objects and implementations which can be
  used for testing, debugging, and running applications; notably Nomad. A number
  of styles can be run depending on requirements. AWS provides the cloud
  deployment option, Multipass for local VMs, and local for running on the base
  host.

* [workstation](./workstation): Configuration options I use for local
  workstations which usually consist of macOS and Linux machines.
